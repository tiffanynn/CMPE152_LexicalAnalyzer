# CMPE152_LexicalAnalyzer
Lexical analyzer in C++

**By**: Austin Tran, Tiffany Nguyen, Hanna Oh, & Tien Tran

Instructions on how to build it:
1. Make sure you have an IDE or use Terminal to run the analyzer
2. For IDE: Just make sure your IDE supports C/C++, download our files and put it into one project, build it, and the output should show in the console

For terminal:
We installed a g++ compiler using the command: sudo apt-get install build-essential

** Then, we compiled our file main_boi.c in the command: gcc+ lexer.h main.cpp token.h

** Just type "./a.out" and the output will show up on the terminal
